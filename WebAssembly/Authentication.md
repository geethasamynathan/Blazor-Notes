Authentication in Blazor web assembly

# Authentication Scenarios in Blazor WebAssembly
Blazor WebAssembly supports several authentication scenarios, including:

Individual Accounts: Uses ASP.NET Core Identity for user management. This is suitable for applications that require user registration, login, and other user management tasks3.

Social Logins: Integrates with third-party identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft using OpenID Connect (OIDC).

Token-based Authentication: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, which is more secure and flexible compared to cookie-based authentication.

Standalone Authentication: Uses the Blazor WebAssembly Authentication library (Authentication.js) with the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) authorization code flow.

Custom Authentication: Allows developers to implement custom authentication flows using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
